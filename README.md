## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Lights Out Alarm
* This is an app integrated with minimal hardware that will allow the user to wake up closer to the time they initially desired. By shutting off only when the light sensor on the hardware reads that the lights in the room have been turned on, it will make going back to sleep after hitting the snooze button much more difficult.

* Stretch Goals:
    * Sounding the alarm again if the lights have turned off within one minute of being turned on.

    * Allowing a the light sensitivity to be adjustable so it can work for a daytime sleeper.

    * Implementing the ability to turn the lights on when the alarm begins, as well as, moving out of my reach. 
    For turning the lights on, it would need some integration software for my lighting system OR have it's own lighting that can simulate sunrise.
    For the mobility, it would need a motor, wheels/tracks and sensors to avoid obstacles.

    * Integrating a weather app that will tell the user how the conditions will be at the start and end of the transit to their destination.

    * Integrating a music database, or any online streaming music to be the alarm. As well as, hooking it up to a larger stereo system.

### Technologies
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with Ultimate CanaKit, SunFounder 7" TFT Screen with Speakers, SunFounder Light Sensor Module, Linux, Python, Moment.js.
